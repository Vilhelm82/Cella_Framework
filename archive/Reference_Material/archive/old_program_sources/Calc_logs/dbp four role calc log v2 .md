# DBP Four-Role Coupling Carrier — Running Calculation Log

## ▶ COLD OPEN — read this first (zero-context start)

**What this is.** The Lloyd/DBP framework (Directive-Based Products, `D ⊕ S = P`) diagnoses coupling faults and constraint-surface geometry through the intrinsic curvature `K_G` of a defining surface `F = 0`. *This* log is one workstream: take the multi-role coupling up the role-count axis and pin down exactly **what invariant the coupling carries** under the role-permutation symmetry `S_n`, and **what a compressed summary of it discards**.

**Definitions are NOT in this file.** "Active Role-Jet", channel reduction (§6), carrier-faithfulness (§7.3), the keystone surfaces, `A_c` — all defined in `/mnt/project/`: `role_channel_anisotropy.tex`, `dbp_orbit_calculus.pdf`, `self_glue_monodromy.pdf`. Read those for the machinery. The working register (anti-sycophantic, exact-ℚ, certainty-tiered, "no eulogies on gaps") is in memory, not here.

**What's settled.** Proved for all n (CALC-14): the carrier is the role-pair module `Im(L) ≅ triv ⊕ std ⊕ S^(n−2,2)`; magnitude-only summaries keep `triv ⊕ std` and discard the shape `S^(n−2,2)`. Standing conclusions 1–8 are the settled set, each carrying its tier — `[proven]` items are **closed; do not relitigate them.**

**Where it's live.** The central theorem is closed, so the workstream is at a **fork**, not mid-derivation. Open directions are the Frontier map (F1–F7) and the Open/next list — pick deliberately; nothing is forced. The most concrete loose thread is the finite two-state witness (the Kerr–Newman analog), which needs the 2-dim fiber actually solved, not just dimension-counted.

### ▶ Methodology — how this workstream is run (load-bearing, not preamble)

**(1) Map the space — do not tunnel on a target.** The objective is never "prove T". It is: **exhaust each identity — map where it reaches and where it breaks, and mark where it branches and joins.** Naming a single target narrows the search and forfeits everything the surrounding space would have revealed. Operationally: every time a computation walks *one* axis hard (order `r`, role-count `n`, separability, solvability…), the **transverse** territory it skipped is logged as a standing return target — that is exactly what the **Frontier map (F1–F7)** below is: a deliberate inventory of single-direction cuts and their blank margins. Closing the nearest result and moving on is the failure mode; keeping the map honest is the method. (The map is also where the project's *shape* is recorded — e.g. that everything clean so far lives in the "solvable corner": `r = 2`, `n ≤ 4`, separable. That observation is itself a lead, not a comfort.)

**(2) Imported math is a suspect, never an authority.** A named theorem / named formula / off-the-shelf decomposition carries the **conclusion of a *different* investigative path** — it brings that path's vocabulary and its tacit claim to be *the* natural articulation. Imported as substrate it forecloses on what our own machinery would find, and it can **mislabel our own transitions**. Standing protocol when an import names one of our phenomena:
- **demote** it to a *navigation target* (where to aim), never a closing argument;
- **reproduce** the phenomenon on our own machinery (measure the wall on our own commutators; build the table from scratch, not transcribed);
- **keep any transition the import is blind to** as positive evidence that it mislabels the event.

*Worked example (load-bearing).* Abel–Ruffini "explains" the n=4→5 boundary as the solvable/non-solvable line — but it is structurally **blind** to the n=3→4 transition (none → quotient shape), which is the carrier's most important move and sits *entirely inside* the solvable region (S₃, S₄ both solvable). So solvability is the **wrong reading** of our transition; the honest object underneath is the **normal-subgroup lattice**, of which solvability is just one lossy projection. We then *measured* the wall ourselves — the derived series stalling at A₅ (CALC-11) — instead of citing the theorem. This is **Axiom 11** in practice: named theorems are domain articulations, not substrate. Full statements: Import-audit principle + Lattice frame in the Frontier map below.

**Workstream:** extend the Active Role-Jet / role-channel theory up the role-count axis (n = 3 onward) and characterise the invariant the coupling actually carries. **STATUS — central result PROVED for all n (CALC-14):** the realizable coupling carrier is the role-pair permutation module, and what any per-chart-magnitude summary discards is exactly the Specht module S^(n−2,2). The n = 3→4 extension that opened the workstream (CALC-01…10) is now a single case of a general theorem.

**Convention:** all arithmetic exact-ℚ (sympy `Rational`/`Matrix`). Certainty tiers inline: `[computer-verified]` (exact CAS on a specific instance), `[proven]` (exact algebraic fact / representation theory), `[noted]` (observation, not a theorem).

**Source framework — definitions live here, NOT in this log.** The DBP role-channel + Active Role-Jet papers in `/mnt/project/`: `role_channel_anisotropy.tex`, `dbp_orbit_calculus.pdf`, `self_glue_monodromy.pdf`. The keystone surfaces, A_c, and the §6 / §7.3 references throughout point into these. A reader new to "Active Role-Jet", "channel reduction", "graph Hessian", or "the carrier" should read those first (and the persona/register lives in memory, not here).

**Scripts (this directory):** `step1_carrier.py` (CALC-01…04) · `faithfulness.py` (05–07) · `loss_location.py` (08–09) · `resolvent_s3.py` (10) · `n5_test.py` (11) · `n6_test.py` (12) · `ladder_faithfulness.py` (13) · `prove_imL.py` (14). **Proof note (self-contained):** `imL_pair_module_theorem.md`.

**Full detail / transcripts:** this session (n=5…14 + the proof) is `2026-06-29-04-10-49-lloyd-dbp-role-pair-proof.txt`; the opening n=3→4 carrier work is `2026-06-29-02-02-48-lloyd-dbp-four-role-carrier.txt`. Computations below were run with the visible exact outputs recorded inline.

**BOTTOM LINE (current).** For all n ≥ 3, the realizable coupling carrier **`Im(L) ≅ M^(n−2,2) = triv ⊕ std ⊕ S^(n−2,2)`** — the permutation module of S_n on the C(n,2) role-pairs — **proved** (CALC-14, via: ker L = the defining-function gauge ⇒ Im(L) ≅ Sym²(std), whose character is the role-pair character). The per-role coupling magnitudes **(C) span the marginal `triv ⊕ std`**; the **loss** — what every magnitude-only summary discards — is exactly the **shape `S^(n−2,2)`**: *absent* at n=3 (A_c is then the whole story), the exceptional **quotient** doublet (2,2) at n=4 (the V₄ accident), and **faithful** for n ≥ 5 with faithfulness margin growing linearly as 2(n−3). Loss dim = n(n−3)/2. **A_c = 42793/1555848** (on the keystone `D²+DS+P²−3` at (1,1,1)) is the n=3 shadow of this structure. The n=4 reading — carrier forced to 12 components, minimal faithful carrier = 4 magnitudes + a (2,2) doublet — survives as standing conclusions 1 & 4, now corollaries rather than the headline.

## CALC-01 — §6 channel reduction, keystone retrodiction  (`step1_carrier.py`, P1)

**What:** implement the section-6 channel-density bordered-minor reduction (ambient implicit form) and reproduce the single-chart Gaussian decomposition on the keystone.
**Inputs:** `F = x₁² + x₁x₂ + x₃² − 3` at `(1,1,1)`. `g = (3,1,2)`, `q = gᵀg = 14`, `H` split into off-diagonal `H_c` + diagonal `H_s`.
**Results (all match the paper, exact):**
- `κ_c (t²) = −1/49`
- `κ_int (t·u) = −3/49`
- `κ_s (u²) = +1/49`
- `K_G = κ_c + κ_int + κ_s = −3/49`

**Tier:** `[computer-verified]`. Validates the §6 machinery.

---

## CALC-02 — Coupling carrier / A_c retrodiction — THE GATE  (`step1_carrier.py`, P2)

**What:** build the coupling carrier from the three per-output-chart graph Hessians and reproduce A_c. This is the gate that validates the carrier definition against the existing role-channel paper before any n=4 extension.
**Inputs:** `F = D² + DS + P² − 3` at `(1,1,1)`. Graph jets computed per output chart via the implicit second-derivative formula `f_jl = −(F_jl + F_jk f_l + F_kl f_j + F_kk f_j f_l)/F_k`.
**Results (exact, all match):**
- `κ_c^(P) = −25/196`
- `κ_c^(D) = −1/441`
- `κ_c^(S) = −1/49`
- `A_c = (κ_P−κ_D)² + (κ_D−κ_S)² + (κ_S−κ_P)² = 42793/1555848`  ← target hit exactly.

**Tier:** `[computer-verified]`. **GATE PASS.**

---

## CALC-03 — n=4 carrier (A): S₄ representation of the 12 components  (`step1_carrier.py`, P3)

**What:** carry the same rule to n=4. Each output chart now has 3 input-pairs, so a component is indexed by (output role k, input-pair) ≡ ordered pair `(k, ℓ)` of distinct roles (ℓ = excluded input). S₄ permutes the 12 ordered pairs. Decompose the module via character inner products with the five S₄ irreps.
**Results:**
- ordered-pairs permutation character `χ = (12, 2, 0, 0, 0)` over classes `(e, (12), (12)(34), (123), (1234))`.
- **12-dim module = trivial ⊕ 2·standard ⊕ (standard⊗sign) ⊕ (2,2)** — multiplicities `(1, 0, 2, 1, 1)` for `(triv, sign, std, std⊗sgn, 2dim)`. Dim check = 12.
- anisotropy (non-trivial) dimension = 11.
- n=3 comparison: 3-component module = `triv ⊕ std(2-dim of S₃)`, exactly **one** nontrivial irrep → A_c is the lone anisotropy invariant. The collapse to a single invariant is special to n=3.

**Tier:** `[proven]` (representation theory; character orthogonality, hand- and code-verified).

---

## CALC-04 — n=4 carrier on a concrete surface; isotypic populations  (`step1_carrier.py`, P4)

**What:** compute the 12 exact-ℚ carrier components on a minimal 4-role surface and project onto S₄ isotypic blocks (preliminary population evidence; Parseval check).
**Inputs:** `F = Σ y_i² + Σ_{i<j} y_i y_j − 65` (fully-coupled symmetric quadratic) at the asymmetric point `(1,2,3,4)`; gradient `(11,12,13,14)` (regular).
**12 carrier components (exact-ℚ), indexed (output, excluded):**
```
(0,1) -8836/12006225   (0,2) -361/592900     (0,3) -6241/12006225
(1,0) -529/893025      (1,2) -361/893025     (1,3) -5041/14288400
(2,0) -27889/67076100  (2,1) -5776/16769025  (2,3) -4489/16769025
(3,0) -6241/19448100   (3,1) -5329/19448100  (3,2) -529/2160900
```
**Isotypic norms ‖P_V v‖²:** trivial, standard, std⊗sgn, twodim all **nonzero**; sign **zero**. Parseval: isotypic norms sum to `‖v‖²` ✓.
**Caveat / superseded:** this projects the *squared* carrier at an *asymmetric* frame, so the std⊗sgn population here is a quadratic shadow, not independent realizable content (see CALC-08).

**Tier:** `[computer-verified, one surface]`.

---

## CALC-05 — n=3 faithfulness Jacobian retrodiction  (`faithfulness.py`, i)

**What:** sanity-check the Jacobian machinery by reproducing the paper's §7.3 carrier-faithfulness determinant at n=3.
**Inputs:** quadratic graph `P = f(D,S)` with symbolic 2-jet `(a,b,A,B,C)`, carrier `O = (κ_c^P, κ_c^D, κ_c^S)`.
**Results:**
- `det ∂O/∂(A,B,C) = 8 Λ_P Λ_D Λ_S / q₀⁶` with `Λ_P=B, Λ_D=(Ab−aB)/a, Λ_S=(Ca−bB)/b, q₀=1+a²+b²` — **symbolic match True**.
- rank 3 at generic jet `(a,b,A,B,C)=(2,3,1,5,7)` = dim(second jet) → faithful at n=3.

**Tier:** `[computer-verified]`. Validates the Jacobian setup used for the n=4 clinch.

---

## CALC-06 — n=4 faithfulness: carrier (A) vs (C) — THE CLINCH  (`faithfulness.py`, ii)

**What:** the second jet at n=4 (graph Hessian) is 6-dimensional. Faithfulness ⇔ carrier-map Jacobian has rank 6. Compare the pair-resolved carrier (A) against any per-chart-scalar carrier (C).
**Inputs:** quadratic 4-role surface, fixed generic 1-jet `(a₁,a₂,a₃)=(2,3,5)`, symbolic 6-entry Hessian, generic evaluation `H=(1,2,4,3,5,7)`.
**Results:**
- `dim(second jet) = 6`.
- **carrier (A): R⁶ → R¹², rank 6 → FAITHFUL.**
- **carrier (C): R⁶ → R⁴, rank 4 → NOT FAITHFUL.** Codomain dim 4 < 6 ⇒ rank ≤ 4 *everywhere* ⇒ (C) is faithful **nowhere** (not merely on a degeneracy locus).
- `ker(J_C)` is **2-dimensional**; both kernel directions are visible to (A) (`J_A · dir` nonzero in 11/12 components each). The information (C) discards is exactly what (A) retains.

**Tier:** `[computer-verified]` (ranks, exact) / `[proven]` (dimensional argument for (C)). **Carrier (A) is forced by the completeness criterion.**

---

## CALC-07 — Finite two-jet witness attempt  (`faithfulness.py`, iii)

**What:** try to exhibit two distinct Hessians with identical (C) but different (A) (the n=4 analog of the Kerr-Newman two-state demo), by moving along a `ker(J_C)` line.
**Result:** along the single kernel line tried, the only common return root of `(C)(s) − C₀` is `s = 0`. The §7.3 criterion is the *local-diffeomorphism / Jacobian* test, so the infinitesimal kernel (CALC-06) already establishes the failure rigorously. A genuine finite pair requires solving the 2-dim fiber `(C)(H) = (C)(H₀)` (4 eqns, 6 unknowns) rather than a straight kernel line — deferred.

**Tier:** `[noted]`.

---

## CALC-08 — Locating the loss: size vs shape, and Im(L) decomposition  (`loss_location.py`)

**What:** determine *where* the (C)-loss sits, at the S₄-**symmetric** first jet (gradient `(1,1,1,1)`, i.e. `a_i = −1`) so the active role action is a genuine linear S₄ representation and isotypic statements are exact.
**Key identity (by construction):** `(C)_k = −(1/q²) Σ_pairs Λ²` = **per-chart sum of squares of the coupling numerators** → (C) keeps each chart's coupling *magnitude*, discards within-chart *shape*. Verified.
**Results:**
- linear map `L: Hessian(R⁶) → numerators(R¹²)` has **rank 6** (injective); `J_A` rank 6, `J_C` rank 4, `ker(J_C)` dim 2 — consistent with CALC-06 at the symmetric jet.
- **Im(L) (realizable coupling numerators, 6-dim) = trivial ⊕ standard ⊕ (2,2)** — confirmed S₄-invariant subrep, dim check 6.
- (C) resolves `triv ⊕ std` (the 4 per-chart magnitudes, transforming as the 4-chart permutation rep).
- **THE LOSS sits entirely in the 2-dimensional (2,2) irrep** — lost dimension = 2, exactly `dim ker(J_C)`. One irreducible doublet, the whole of it.
- The (2,2) irrep **factors through S₄/V₄ ≅ S₃**: the lost shape coordinate is governed by the S₃ quotient of S₄.

**Tier:** `[computer-verified]` (exact-ℚ; isotypic projectors built from the S₄ permutation rep).

---

## CALC-09 — Constructive payoff: minimal faithful carrier  (`loss_location.py`, appended)

**What:** test whether (C)'s 4 magnitudes augmented with the (2,2) shape doublet is already faithful.
**Inputs:** augmented carrier `[ (C) (4) ; P_{(2,2)} κ (2-dim block) ]`, symmetric jet, generic Hessian.
**Result:** augmented Jacobian **rank 6 → FAITHFUL**. So the minimal faithful carrier = **4 magnitudes + 2 shape (the (2,2) doublet) = 6 = dim(second jet)**; the full 12 components of (A) are redundant.

**Refinement of earlier claim (CALC-03/04):** the abstract 12-component module has room for `2·std ⊕ std⊗sgn ⊕ 2dim`, but the *realizable* numerators occupy only `triv ⊕ std ⊕ (2,2)`. So the genuinely independent new content beyond the magnitudes is the **single (2,2) doublet**; the std⊗sgn seen in CALC-04 is a quadratic shadow of the (2,2)+magnitude data, not an independent invariant.

**Tier:** `[computer-verified]`.

---

## CALC-10 — Is the resolvent S₃ a third independent S₃?  (`resolvent_s3.py`)

**What:** the (2,2) shape doublet (CALC-08) is governed by an S₃. Test whether it is a *third independent* S₃ — like the monodromy-S₃ the self-glue paper found independent of role-S₃ (the S₃ × S₃ commuting pair) — or a quotient of the role group. Discriminator (the monodromy paper's own test): an S₃ is independent only if it acts on a set with no canonical bijection to the roles.
**Results:**
- V₄ = {e, (01)(23), (02)(13), (03)(12)} is exactly `ker(S₄ → Sym(3 partitions))`; quotient order 6 = |S₃|, surjective onto Sym(3 partitions). `[computer-verified]`
- Each double-transposition acts as the **identity** on the (2,2) block but **nontrivially** on the carrier overall and on the std blocks — the shape doublet sees only the quotient; V₄ does real work elsewhere. `[computer-verified]`
- Permutation rep on the three 2+2 partitions: character `(3,1,3,0,1)` = `triv ⊕ (2,2)`. So the (2,2) shape doublet **is** the standard rep of the resolvent S₃ on the partitions, V₄ its kernel. `[computer-verified]`
- Galois/monodromy bridge: `x⁴ − x − 1` (Gal S₄) → resolvent cubic `y³ + 4y − 1`, irreducible, discriminant −283 (non-square) → Gal = S₃ = S₄/V₄. The resolvent S₃ is realised as the monodromy of the resolvent cubic — but that monodromy is again S₄/V₄. `[computer-verified]`

**Verdict:** the resolvent S₃ is a *new* group (S₄/V₄, absent at n=3) but **NOT an independent** S₃. It is the role group's resolvent **quotient**, canonically determined by the role action (the partitions are built from the roles), unlike the monodromy-S₃ which acted on root-sheets with no canonical role-bijection. It IS genuinely the resolvent-cubic monodromy — a concrete bridge to cover/Galois machinery — but still role-determined. A genuinely independent factor (the n=4 analog of S₃ × S₃) would require a four-role branched cover, whose sheets are not role-canonical (→ F-list below).

**Tier:** `[computer-verified]` / `[proven]` (quotient-vs-independent is structural).

---

## CALC-11 — n=5 decisive test: loss goes faithful; solvability wall measured  (`n5_test.py`)

**What:** the decisive test of the Lattice frame at the lattice-collapse point. Compute the n=5 carrier (S₅, 30 components, 10-dim second jet), localize the loss, check whether it can stay quotient-shaped (frame says it **cannot** — S₅'s only proper quotient is Z/2, so only triv/sign factor through it). Companion: *measure* the solvability transition via the derived series (actual commutators), demoting the Abel–Ruffini import.
**Carrier results (S₅-symmetric jet, exact-ℚ):**
- rank L = 10 (injective), all Q_k = 5. rank J_A = 10 → **(A) faithful at n=5**. rank J_C = 5 → loss = 5-dim.
- **Im(L) (realizable numerators, 10-dim) = triv(5) ⊕ std(4,1) ⊕ (3,2)**. dim check 10.
- (C) resolves triv ⊕ std(4,1) (the 5 per-chart magnitudes).
- **LOSS = (3,2), a single 5-dimensional FAITHFUL irrep** — all 5 dims faithful, 0 quotient. Prediction (≥4 of 5 faithful) **CONFIRMED**, in fact all 5.

**Structural law (what the test surfaced).** The loss/shape is the Specht module **S^{(n−2,2)}**, the non-magnitude summand of `Im(L) = S^{(n)} ⊕ S^{(n−1,1)} ⊕ S^{(n−2,2)}` (trivial ⊕ standard ⊕ shape):
- n=3: (n−2,2) = (1,2) is not a valid partition → **no shape**; (C)=(A), no loss, A_c is the faithful whole story.
- n=4: (2,2), the **exceptional quotient** irrep (factors through S₄/V₄) → shape = quotient doublet (CALC-08/10).
- n≥5: faithful → shape = faithful irrep ((3,2) at n=5).
Loss dim = dim S^{(n−2,2)} = **n(n−3)/2** [confirmed n=4→2, n=5→5], and `1 + (n−1) + n(n−3)/2 = n(n−1)/2 = dim(2nd jet)` for all n. *[computer-verified at n=3,4,5; the all-n law is conjecture]*

**Derived series — solvability wall MEASURED (commutators, not citation):**
- S₃: orders [6, 3, 1] → solvable. S₄: [24, 12, 4, 1] → solvable. S₅: [120, 60] → **STALLS at A₅ (perfect)** → non-solvable.
- S₄'' = order 4 = **V₄** = the n=4 shape-quotient kernel (CALC-10). The carrier's shape mechanism *is* the second derived subgroup of S₄.

**Verdict.** The Lattice frame holds at its decisive point and predicted the transition; "loss = quotient doublet" was the n=4 V₄-accident, not a law. The shape survives for all n≥4 but changes character **quotient → faithful at exactly n=5** — the lattice-collapse / solvability-failure point. The carrier-shape is the **finer** reading: it transitions at *both* n=3→4 (none→quotient, solvability blind) and n=4→5 (quotient→faithful, solvability also fails). Two distinct projections of the lattice, carrier strictly finer — now confirmed at a second point. The Abel–Ruffini import (F2/F5) is demoted to a measured fact: the wall sits at n=5 for our role groups, produced on our own commutators.

**Tier:** `[computer-verified]` (n=5 carrier + derived series, exact) / `[conjecture]` (the all-n Specht S^{(n−2,2)} law).

---

## CALC-12 — n=6: Specht law confirmed (2nd faithful point); loss = role-pair module  (`n6_test.py`)

**What:** confirm the Specht loss law at a *second* faithful point. n=6 carrier (S₆, 60 components, 15-dim jet). The S₆ character table is built from scratch via **Murnaghan–Nakayama** and verified (dims {1,1,5,5,9,9,10,10,5,5,16}, sign character, all 11 norms = 1) before use — no transcribed table.
**Results (S₆-symmetric jet, exact-ℚ):**
- rank L = 15 (injective), all Q_k = 6. rank J_A = 15 → (A) faithful. rank J_C = 6 → loss = 9 = n(n−3)/2.
- Im(L) = triv(6) ⊕ std(5,1) ⊕ (4,2). dim 15.
- **LOSS = S^(4,2), single irrep, dim 9, FAITHFUL** — exactly predicted. Second faithful data point after (3,2) at n=5.
- S₆ derived series [720, 360] stalls at A₆ → non-solvable (wall persists).

**Upgrade — the clean form of the law.** Across n=4,5,6, `Im(L) = triv ⊕ std(n−1,1) ⊕ S^(n−2,2)`, which is exactly the decomposition of the **permutation module of S_n on the C(n,2) role-pairs**, M^(n−2,2) = ℂ[role-pairs]. So the realizable coupling carrier **is** the role-pair permutation module (dim C(n,2)); the n−2 chart-views of each pair are redundant (n·C(n−1,2) carrier components collapse to C(n,2) realizable). (C) keeps the **marginal** part triv ⊕ std (per-pair magnitudes summed to per-chart); the **loss is the S^(n−2,2) part** — absent at n=3 ((n−2,2) invalid → no loss, A_c whole story), the exceptional **quotient** (2,2) at n=4 (the V₄ accident), **faithful** for all n≥5 ((3,2), (4,2), …). Loss dim = dim S^(n−2,2) = n(n−3)/2.

**Tier:** `[computer-verified n=3,4,5,6]` (MN table independently verified) / `[conjecture]` (all-n; the role-pair-module identification makes it a clean target for a general proof, likely provable directly).

## CALC-13 — climbing past n=6: the faithfulness-margin pattern  (`ladder_faithfulness.py`)

**What:** climb past n=6 to (i) confirm the role-pair-module law at more rungs and (ii) ask whether "how faithful each rung is" forms a pattern. Cheap exact handle: the loss S^(n−2,2) has character `χ_shape(g) = C(fix,2) + #2cycles − fix` (= χ_pair − χ_triv − χ_std), an exact rep-theory identity.

**(A) Pair-module law — confirmed at n=7, 8.** rank L = C(n,2) and `χ_Im(L)(g) = χ_pair(g) = C(fix,2)+#2cycles` on *every* conjugacy class, for n=5,6,7,8. So Im(L) **is** the role-pair module M^(n−2,2) at n=4,5,6 (exact, CALC-08/11/12) and n=7,8 (numerically verified, integer-clean). Loss = S^(n−2,2) at every rung tested.

**(B) The faithfulness margin — a clean graded pattern.** Define `margin := dim − max_{g≠e} χ_shape(g)` (how far the nearest non-identity element is from acting trivially; 0 = unfaithful). Computed n=3..20:
- n=3: no shape rep (A_c whole story).
- n=4: kernel = **V₄** (order 4: identity + 3 double-transpositions), **not faithful, margin 0**.
- n≥5: kernel trivial, faithful, **margin = 2(n−3)** exactly — 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, … growing linearly.
The least-faithful element settles to a single transposition for n≥7 (`χ_shape = (n−3)(n−4)/2`, giving margin 2(n−3)).

**The pattern.** Faithfulness grows **linearly up the ladder** (margin 2(n−3)) — each rung strictly more robustly faithful — with a **singular collapse to 0 at n=4** (the margin sits *below* the extrapolated line: 0, not the 2 that 2(n−3) would give). The dip is the V₄ accident: at n=4 the double-transpositions form a normal subgroup **and** act trivially on S^(2,2) (which factors through S₄/V₄). This is the **same V₄** as the shape-quotient kernel (CALC-08/10) and S₄'' in the derived series (CALC-11) — one structure, three appearances.

**Tier:** margin = 2(n−3) and kernel = V₄-only-at-n=4 are `[proven]` rep-theory facts about S^(n−2,2) (χ_shape is its exact character); "loss = S^(n−2,2)" is `[computer-verified n=4..8; all-n conjecture]`.

---

## CALC-14 — PROOF: Im(L) ≅ role-pair module (conjecture → theorem)  (`prove_imL.py`, `imL_pair_module_theorem.md`)

**What:** prove the all-n conjecture (CALC-12/13) that the realizable coupling carrier is the role-pair permutation module. Reduces to two elementary facts; load-bearing steps verified n=4..9, proof general.

**Theorem.** For all n ≥ 3, `Im(L) ≅ M^(n−2,2) = ℂ[role-pairs] = triv ⊕ std ⊕ S^(n−2,2)` as S_n-reps.

**Proof (3 steps).** Numerator `Λ_{k,{j,l}}(H) = −(H_{jl} − H_{jk} − H_{kl} + H_{kk})` on ambient `H ∈ Sym²(ℝ^n)`; S_n-equivariant.
- **Step 1 [gauge].** `ker L = G = {v⊗g + g⊗v}` = the defining-function rescaling freedom `F → φF` (which shifts H by `∇φ⊗g + g⊗∇φ`). Proven by explicit construction `v_a = H_{a0} − ½H_{00}`. So `rank L = dim Sym²(ℝ^n) − n = C(n,2)`. *(verified n=4..7: rank L = C(n,2), ker dim = n, gauge generators independent and span ker)*
- **Step 2 [quotient].** `Im(L) ≅ Sym²(ℝ^n)/G ≅ Sym²(std)`, since `Sym²(ℝ^n) = triv ⊕ std ⊕ Sym²(std)` and G is exactly the g-involving part `Sym²(triv) ⊕ (triv⊗std)`.
- **Step 3 [character].** `χ_{Sym²std}(g) = ½(χ_std(g)² + χ_std(g²)) = C(fix,2) + #2cycles` = role-pair character. *(verified n=4..9)* So `Sym²(std) ≅ M^(n−2,2)`.
∴ `Im(L) ≅ M^(n−2,2)`. ∎

**Corollary (loss).** (C) (per-role coupling magnitude) spans the marginal `triv ⊕ std`; the **loss = S^(n−2,2)** for all n: absent n=3, quotient (2,2) at n=4, faithful n≥5 with margin 2(n−3) (CALC-13).

**Consequence.** Standing conclusion 6 is now `[proven for all n]`. The loss-shape law, the dimension n(n−3)/2, the quotient→faithful transition, and the faithfulness margin 2(n−3) with its V₄ dip — all CALC-08…13 empirics — were rep-theory facts about S^(n−2,2) awaiting this identification; they are now theorems.

**Tier:** `[proven]` (general proof; load-bearing steps computer-verified n=4..9).

## CALC-15 — order axis r: the parity law is the normalization; no new rep structure this way  (`order_axis_v1.py`)

**What:** open the order axis (F1, the largest frontier blank). Generalise the channel density `Ĉ_r(t,u)` — the role-channel paper's **§8** higher-order conjecture (the r=2 `(t,u)`-reduction itself traces to the orbit-calculus foundational paper, not role-channel §6) — bordered minors of `M = tH_c + uH_s` (H_c off-diagonal/coupling, H_s diagonal/self), normalised by `q^((r+2)/2)`, from the hardcoded top order `r=n−1` to arbitrary r. Gate, then compute r=1..4 and test the paper's conjectured parity law (`role_channel_anisotropy.tex` §8: ℚ for even r, ℚ(√q) for odd r).

**Gates (retrodiction, exact).** GATE-A ambient `Ĉ_2` on the keystone → −1/49, −3/49, +1/49, K_G=−3/49 ✓. GATE-B per-chart `Ĉ_2` on the A_c surface → κ_c^{P,D,S} = −25/196, −1/441, −1/49, A_c = 42793/1555848 ✓. Parametric machinery validated against both prior results.

**Parity law — CONFIRMED, and it is the normalization (not a deep arithmetic fact).** On a concrete n=5 surface, q = 495 = 9·55 (√q = 3√55 irrational): every coefficient of `Ĉ_1`, `Ĉ_3` lies in ℚ(√q); every coefficient of `Ĉ_2`, `Ĉ_4` lies in ℚ. **Mechanism (structural, proven):** the bordered-minor total is a polynomial in the rational jet, so the field is fixed entirely by `norm = q^((r+2)/2)` — an integer power of q for even r (→ ℚ), and `q^k·√q` for odd r (→ ℚ(√q)). Odd-r coefficients are **pure** √q multiples (no rational part), and √q does not cancel (leading coupling ≠ 0). Geometrically this is the even/odd mean-curvature dichotomy: even orders clear the normal normalization, odd orders carry one factor of the unit normal (the √q).

**Order-r role anisotropy `A_c^(r)` (= std-irrep norm² of the per-chart t^r coupling family):** nonzero for r=2,3,4 and **rational for all r** — including r=3, where the densities themselves carry √q — because `A_c^(r)` is degree-2 in the densities and a pure-√q term clears under squaring. So the parity √q lives at the *oriented-density* level and is **invisible to the anisotropy invariant** (rational at every order). The √q is a feature of signed curvature, not of the role variance.

**Honest verdict — what the order axis did and did not give.** The paper's named conjecture is discharged (true, but it is the normal-bundle √q, not an arithmetic miracle), measured on our own machinery and explained. But the per-chart std-norm anisotropy **stays in the same irrep (std) at every order** — climbing r this way surfaces **no new representation structure**, in sharp contrast to the role axis (→ Sym²(std), deeper Specht modules). The genuine open frontier on the order axis is the **order-r per-(chart, (r+1)-subset) coupling carrier** — an r×r coupling minor of the Hessian, a degree-r (nonlinear) object — whose S_n-content *could* carry the deeper Specht modules S^(n−r,r). That is a design problem, not a quick computation, and is the real (r,n)-plane work.

**Tier:** gates `[computer-verified]`; parity law `[computer-verified on n=5; normalization mechanism proven]`; `A_c^(r)` rational `[computer-verified; squaring-clears-√q proven]`; the deeper-rep order-r carrier `[open design problem]`.

**CALC-15a — cross-check against the compiled role-channel PDF (`verify_against_paper.py`).** The PDF was uploaded mid-session (it was *not* in `/mnt/project/` at start — only the `.tex` was); this re-verifies the machinery against the paper's exact numbers now that the compiled source is in hand. Confirmed exactly: Def-1 channel triple (Λ_P,Λ_D,Λ_S) = (−5/4, 1/6, 1/2); κ_c = (−25/196, −1/441, −1/49); A_c = 42793/1555848. **Remark 1 (§5) precision:** the paper warns the *plain* bordered Hessian is a different (Gauss–Kronecker-type) invariant, not the coupling channel — verified (it returns ±1/2 on chart P, ≠ Λ_P = −5/4). Our graded `Ĉ_r` is on the right side of this: at u=0 only `H_c` survives, and the t²-coefficient returns −25/196 = κ_c^P, so the `(t,u)`-grading is exactly what recovers the coupling channel. **Design consequence for the v2 order-r carrier:** use **coupling-mode (`H_c`) minors** (the t^r part), never full bordered Hessians, or it computes the Gauss–Kronecker object the paper rules out. `[computer-verified against PDF]`

## CALC-16 — characteristic axis: Campaign H's char-2 boundary generalises to all n  (`char2_generalization.py`)

**Context.** Will's parallel **Campaign H** (uploaded `CHAR2_BOUNDARY_REPORT.md`, `RAW_CHART_ROLECHSPEC_REPORT.md`; CL-H8/H9/H10) studies the *same carrier as CALC-14*, at n=3, on a new axis: **field characteristic**. Their gauge `G_g(a) = g_i a_j + g_j a_i` **is** our gauge `G = {v⊗g + g⊗v}` (v=a); their "carrier O" = `Sym₃/Im(G_g)` is our `Im(L)` at n=3; their faithfulness CL-H4 is the n=3 case of CALC-14, reached by an independent route (explicit minors, Gröbner saturation) — **independent corroboration**. Campaign H finds: faithful over char ≠ 2; a *derived* wall at char 2 (gauge goes diagonal-blind, carrier jumps 3→4-dim); resolved by a **phantom** `g gᵀ` that escapes the char-2 gauge image but stays invisible (CL-H10).

**What:** test whether the char-2 boundary generalises to all n, as the CALC-14 gauge structure predicts.

**Verified (n=3..7, exact, general symbolic g):**
- char ≠ 2: gauge rank = n (CALC-14 step 1) → carrier `Sym²(ℝ^n)/G` = C(n,2)-dim.
- char 2: the diagonal action `2g_i a_i` vanishes; the off-diagonal kernel condition flips from `g_i a_j = −g_j a_i` (forces a=0 over ℚ) to `g_i a_j = +g_j a_i` (allows a ∝ g), so the gauge **rank drops n → n−1**, kernel = ⟨g⟩. (Confirmed: `M·g = 2g_ig_j ≡ 0 mod 2`; some (n−1)-minor odd; all n-minors even.)
- the **phantom** `g gᵀ = G_g(g/2)` has diagonal `g_i²`, absent from the (purely off-diagonal) char-2 gauge image → independent, **restores exactly 1 dimension**.
- **Net: the carrier is C(n,2)-dimensional in EVERY characteristic, for all n.** The wall is the −1→+1 sign flip; the phantom `g gᵀ` (the pure defining-function-rescaling direction v∝g, = the `Sym²(triv)` gauge summand at the symmetric jet) restores the lost dimension.

**Relation to Campaign H / what remains.** This generalises the *gauge/carrier-dimension* skeleton of CL-H8/H9 (n=3) to all n. The remaining piece — that RoleChSpec is actually **faithful** on this C(n,2)-dim carrier in char 2 (i.e. the channel map's char-2 kernel is *exactly* `gauge ⊕ ⟨g gᵀ⟩`, the all-n analog of CL-H10) — needs the channel engine reduced mod 2 and is **not** checked here.

**Tier:** gauge/carrier dimension `[computer-verified n=3..7; mechanism proven]`; all-n RoleChSpec faithfulness in char 2 `[open — CL-H10 analog]`.

## CALC-17 — Campaign H spine (H1–H5) audited; the O-parity; compilation status  (`verify_campaignH_parity.py`)

**Context.** Uploaded Campaign H docs (`GAUGE_NORMAL_FORM_PROOF`, `SYMBOLIC_ROLECHSPEC_FORMULAS`, `INJECTIVITY_IDEAL_REPORT`, `EXCEPTIONAL_LOCUS_REPORT`) = the full **n=3** faithfulness proof: H1 (unique gauge-normal form `H_perp`: zero diagonal, off-diag = obstruction `O`; `Sym₃/Im(G_g) ≅ ℚ³`), H2 (RoleChSpec gauge-invariant), H3 (closed `(g,O)` formulas + the O-parity), H4 (injectivity via r=1 linear recovery, 6×3 rank 3), H5 (exceptional locus → char ≠ 2, the `32 = 2⁵` obstruction).

**Audit (our own channel engine, gauge-normal coords, exact).** κ_int = 0 every chart ✓; **O-parity** r=1 ODD / r=2 EVEN in O ✓; r=1 coefficient matrix rank 3 (injective) ✓; coupling-rows minor numerator carries the constant `32 = 2⁵` (char ≠ 2 obstruction) ✓ — modulo our `q^((r+2)/2)` normalization vs Campaign H's channel normalization (exact minor differs by normalization; substance agrees). **Campaign H's spine is independently confirmed.**

**Cross-connections.**
- H1–H5 (n=3) = the n=3 case of CALC-14 (all-n role-pair module), via a **third independent route** (gauge-normal form + linear recovery) — alongside CALC-14's character argument and the role-channel paper's Prop 1.
- **A second parity, distinct from CALC-15's.** Campaign H's **O-parity** — the order-r density is degree-r in the carrier O, hence EVEN in O for even r (blind to `O ↦ −O`) / ODD for odd r (resolves it) — is the load-bearing fact for **injectivity**: r=1 (odd) fixes the O-sign that r=2 (even) cannot. This is *not* CALC-15's **field-parity** (coeffs ℚ for even r / ℚ(√q) for odd r, = the `q^((r+2)/2)` normalization). Two real parity-by-r structures, one in the carrier, one in the field; the §8 conjecture names the field one, Campaign H found the injectivity one.

**Compilation status (Will's question).** Campaign H is **not** in the role-channel paper. The paper proves n=3 faithfulness via **Prop 1** (the `(A,B,C)→(Λ)` linear iso, det = −1) in **jet** coords and removes poles via the **projective normal** — different machinery. Campaign H = the gauge-theoretic reformulation + the §8 `Ĉ_r` conjecture made concrete (paper: "stated as targets; none verified here") + the **characteristic axis** (absent from the paper). [Orbit-calculus paper `dbp_orbit_calculus.pdf` not re-read this session; the gauge/bordered-minor machinery may partly live there.]

**Synthesis target.** Three parallel n=3 treatments now agree — paper Prop 1 / Campaign H H1–H5 / CALC-14. Unification = **all-n RoleChSpec injectivity at general g** (the all-n H1–H5) + the **all-n char-2 faithfulness** (CL-H10 analog); CALC-14 (gauge quotient, symmetric jet) + CALC-16 (char-2 dimension, all n) are the partial scaffold.

**Tier:** Campaign H spine `[computer-verified — independent re-derivation]`; the two parities `[computer-verified]`; compilation status `[assessment]`.

## Standing conclusions (as of this log)

1. The n=4 coupling carrier is **forced** to be the 12-component pair-resolved object (faithfulness, CALC-06). `[proven]`
2. A_c is the n=3 shadow: S₃ is the unique role count whose carrier collapses to a single nontrivial irrep. `[proven]`
3. Any per-chart-magnitude summary (incl. §6's `κ_{2;2,0}` and the top-order Gauss-Kronecker reading) loses exactly a **2-dim (2,2) shape doublet**, governed by S₃ = S₄/V₄. `[computer-verified]`
4. Minimal faithful carrier = 4 magnitudes + (2,2) shape doublet = 6 components. `[computer-verified]`
5. The S₃ governing the shape doublet is the role group's resolvent quotient S₄/V₄ (= resolvent-cubic monodromy), **not** an independent third S₃; the monodromy-S₃ of the cubic self-glue *was* independent (S₃ × S₃) because it acts on root-sheets, not roles. `[computer-verified/proven]`
6. **The realizable coupling carrier is the role-pair permutation module** `Im(L) ≅ M^{(n−2,2)} = ℂ[C(n,2) pairs] = triv ⊕ std(n−1,1) ⊕ S^{(n−2,2)}`, **proved for all n** (CALC-14): `ker L` = the defining-function gauge `G = {v⊗g+g⊗v}`, so `Im(L) ≅ Sym²(ℝ^n)/G ≅ Sym²(std)`, whose character `C(fix,2)+#2cycles` is the role-pair character. (C) keeps the marginal (triv ⊕ std); **the loss is the shape S^{(n−2,2)}**: absent at n=3 (A_c whole story), exceptional **quotient** (2,2) at n=4 (V₄ accident), **faithful** for n≥5 with margin 2(n−3). Loss dim = n(n−3)/2. `[proven for all n; load-bearing steps computer-verified n=4..9]`
7. **Solvability wall measured on our own commutators** (not Abel–Ruffini): derived series of S₃ [6,3,1], S₄ [24,12,4,1] solvable; S₅ [120,60] stalls at A₅. S₄'' = V₄ = the carrier's shape-quotient kernel. Carrier-shape is the *finer* reading of the normal-subgroup lattice — it transitions at n=3→4 (solvability blind) as well as n=4→5. `[computer-verified]`
8. **Faithfulness of the loss is graded, not binary:** margin (distance of nearest non-identity element from acting trivially) = **2(n−3)** for n≥5 — linear growth, each rung strictly more faithful — with a **singular dip to 0 at n=4** (the V₄ collapse, below the line). Same V₄ as conclusions 3/5/7. Pair-module law confirmed n=4..8. `[proven for S^(n−2,2); loss identity computer-verified n=4..8]`

## Open / next (not yet computed)
- Finite two-state witness against the (2,2) shape invariant (distinct shape, identical magnitude) — the named-invariant n=4 analog of the Kerr-Newman demo.
- Characterize the n=4 isotropy locus where `J_A` drops below rank 6 (factor a 6×6 minor → the n=4 analog of `8Λ_PΛ_DΛ_S/q₀⁶`).
- Prove the (2,2) content nonzero on a Zariski-dense set (genericity, beyond the single surface of CALC-04).
- Physical 4-charge instance where the (2,2) shape coordinate is a live diagnostic.
- **Path-native solvability/lattice derivation** (demotes the Abel–Ruffini imports in F2/F5): compute the normal-subgroup lattice of the role group `S_n` and the *full* derived series of `Sym(m) ≀ Sym(m)` as n,m grow; derive *both* the carrier-quotient mechanism and the solvability filtration from the lattice ourselves; locate every transition, including ones solvability is blind to (n=3→4). Confirm or refute that the wall sits at n=5 / m=5 for our specific modules rather than for bare S_n.

## Frontier map — single-direction cuts and their blank margins

Survey of where the computation walked one axis hard and left the transverse territory unmapped. Each `F#` is a standing return target. Tags mark what is already proven vs. genuinely open. The "Open / next" list above is the near-term tactical subset; this is the strategic survey.

**Meta-shape.** The project has a strong line along **r = 2, n ≤ 4, separable, solvable** — everything clean lives in the solvable corner of symmetric-group structure. Two stacked accidents hold it together: A_c being a single invariant (n=3, S₃ multiplicity-free) and the loss living in a small quotient (n=4, V₄ ◁ S₄). The unmapped territory is everything *transverse* to that line. I earlier called the n=4→5 boundary "the solvable/non-solvable line of classical Galois theory" — **that is an imported reading, flagged below (F2/F5).** The candidate *complete* object underneath both walls is the **normal-subgroup lattice of the role group**, of which solvability and the carrier-quotient mechanism are two distinct projections (Lattice frame, next).

**Import-audit principle (standing).** A named theorem imported as substrate carries the *conclusion* of a different investigative path; jumping to it can rob us of what searching our own space would find. When an import names one of our transitions, demote it to a navigation target, reproduce the phenomenon with our own machinery, and keep any transition the import is *blind to* as evidence it mislabels the event. Cf. Axiom 11 (named theorems are domain articulations, not substrate).

**Lattice frame (working hypothesis, not a result).** Both transitions we can actually see are readings of the role group's normal-subgroup lattice: S₃ has only {1, A₃, S₃}; S₄ **gains the normal V₄** (and A₄) — exactly the V₄ whose quotient S₄/V₄ ≅ S₃ carries the (2,2) shape doublet (CALC-10); S₅ collapses it (nothing proper but the simple A₅). So **n=3→4 = lattice gains V₄ → carrier gains the shape doublet, solvability unchanged**; **n=4→5 = lattice collapses → resolvent mechanism lost *and* solvability fails, simultaneously**. Solvability and the carrier-quotient mechanism are therefore *distinct* readings of one lattice — they **diverge** at n=3→4 (carrier moves, solvability blind) and only **coincide** at n=4→5 where the lattice itself collapses. Not two halves of each other; two projections of the lattice. *[both transitions verified — CALC-03/08/10 + solvability of S₃,S₄; lattice-as-common-source is a working frame on 2 data points]*

**F1 — Order axis r (largest blank by area).** All results are r=2 (Gaussian). The channel bipolynomial `Ĉ_r(t,u)` is defined for all 1 ≤ r ≤ n−1; only the r=2 line is ever evaluated. Unmapped: r=1 (mean-curvature channels), r ≥ 3, the conjectured parity law (ℚ for even r, ℚ(√q) for odd — untested past r=2), a generating function `Σ_r Ĉ_r s^r`, and the kernel of Σ above the zero-sum plane. **→ PARTIALLY MAPPED in CALC-15:** `Ĉ_r` generalised to all r (gated on keystone + A_c); parity law **confirmed and explained** — it is exactly the `q^((r+2)/2)` normalization (the normal-bundle √q at odd order), not a deep arithmetic fact; the order-r role anisotropy `A_c^(r)` is rational and nonzero at every order (the √q is invisible to the squared invariant). What this **left open and reframed**: climbing r via per-chart std-norm surfaces no new representation content (stays in std). The live order-axis target is now the **order-r per-(chart, (r+1)-subset) coupling carrier** (r×r coupling minor, degree-r/nonlinear), whose S_n-content could carry the deeper Specht modules S^(n−r,r) — the genuine (r,n)-plane analog of the role-axis theorem. *[r=1..4 mapped; parity discharged; the deeper order-r carrier is an open design problem]*

**F2 — Role axis n, and the solvability cliff at n=4→5.** Walked 3→4, stopped. Deeper miss: the n=4 cleanliness is an exceptional-group accident. The loss factoring through S₄/V₄ ≅ S₃ exists *because* V₄ ◁ S₄. S₅ has no proper normal subgroup but A₅; its only abelian quotient is Z/2 (sign). So "loss governed by a small symmetric quotient" appears to break at n=5. **⚠ Import flag (Abel–Ruffini):** the "cannot survive to n=5" reading is *imported* (classical Galois road), not produced on our path, and it **mislabels** the event — our actual n=3→4 transition lives *entirely inside* the solvable region (S₃, S₄ both solvable), so solvability is structurally blind to it. The real driver is the normal-subgroup lattice (Lattice frame above), not solvability per se. Pending: path-native derivation (Open list). **→ DISCHARGED in CALC-11:** the wall is now *measured* (derived series stalls at S₅, on our own commutators), and the carrier transition is shown finer than solvability — the shape is the Specht module S^{(n−2,2)}, quotient at n=4, faithful at n=5. *[the bare-S_n facts are proven group theory; that solvability is the right reading of OUR transition is refuted at n=3→4; the carrier law is computer-verified at n=3,4,5]*

**F3 — Degeneracy loci: ranks, never varieties.** Faithfulness reported "rank at a generic point" throughout. At n=3 we had the exact locus `Λ_P Λ_D Λ_S = 0` (four lines); at n=4 we never factored the degeneracy variety (the analog of `8 Λ_P Λ_D Λ_S / q₀⁶` — a 6×6 minor of `J_A`). The isotropy-locus dimension law `dim Z_Σ = 2 − r` is an n=3 statement, never lifted. The boundary where structure fails is the actual geometry, and it is blank. *[generic ranks have; boundary varieties unmapped]*

**F4 — The local↔global isthmus.** The residue↔cycle-type bridge — A_c's pole residue at a role boundary ↔ the monodromy cycle type at that ramification locus — is named as open in the role-channel, GTD, *and* monodromy papers, computed in none. The papers assert local and global are "a quotient and its total space," but the projection map itself is uncomputed. *[named in 3 papers; never calculated]*

**F5 — Separable→non-separable and solvable→non-solvable walls (monodromy side).** Wreath laws mapped only for separable pure-power surfaces (the Lemma C strip). Non-separable cross-terms: does seam-imprimitivity survive or shatter? Named open, never probed. Independent solvability cliff: `Sym(m) ≀ Sym(m)` contains A_m, non-solvable for m ≥ 5; the cubic's `S₃ ≀ S₃` is solvable; the "backward/expensive non-abelian part" is qualitatively different above m=4, only measured at m ≤ 3. The abelianization was pinned ((Z/2)² always) — but abelianization is **blind** to solvability; we read the one invariant that doesn't see the cliff. **⚠ Import flag (Abel–Ruffini), partial:** F5 is *closer to native* than F2 — solvability here is a property of the derived series of `Sym(m) ≀ Sym(m)`, the actual group we built, and we already computed its first rung (abelianization (Z/2)²). But the paper's native questions were abelianization + imprimitivity, not "solvable y/n", so "non-solvable for m ≥ 5" is still imported framing. Path-native move: compute the *full* derived series for m = 2..6 and locate where it stops terminating — measure the transition in our object instead of citing it. *[m ≤ 3 measured; full derived series + m ≥ 5 + non-separable unmapped]*

**F6 — The ambient-curvature wall: never walked along.** R^T doesn't channelize (not bilinear in the shape operator) — a proven, bounded wall. We stopped at it facing forward. Never walked along it: are there special ambients (constant curvature, Einstein, symmetric spaces) where R^T *does* split, or where the obstruction itself carries channel structure? A wall with its length unmapped may have a gate. *[wall proven; its length / possible gates unmapped]*

**F7 — Points standing in for maps.** Nearly every n=3 claim (nowhere-isotropic, the gauge-transport laws, A_c > 0) is witnessed on the *single* keystone surface; the n=4 (2,2) population on one surface, one point. "Generic" is asserted, never shown Zariski-dense. We have pins, not a chart of the surface moduli — and the difference matters exactly where a pin happens to sit on a special locus we haven't identified. *[pins have; moduli chart blank]*

**F8 — Characteristic / field-of-definition axis (opened by Campaign H; extended in CALC-16).** All CALC results are over ℚ (char 0). Campaign H (Will's parallel n=3 work, CL-H8/H9/H10) walks the characteristic: faithful over char ≠ 2; a *derived* wall at char 2 (gauge diagonal-blind, the −1→+1 kernel sign flip), resolved by the phantom `g gᵀ`. CALC-16 generalised the gauge/carrier-dimension skeleton to all n (carrier C(n,2)-dim in every characteristic). Unmapped: the **all-n RoleChSpec faithfulness in char 2** (CL-H10 analog — is the channel map's char-2 kernel exactly `gauge ⊕ ⟨g gᵀ⟩`?); **other primes** (char 3, p) and the **modular representation theory** of the carrier — does `S^(n−2,2)` stay irreducible mod p, and do new phantoms appear at primes dividing structure constants?; the interaction of the characteristic axis with the role-count axis (where the carrier decomposition itself can change mod p). *[char-2 gauge/carrier dimension mapped all n; RoleChSpec char-2 faithfulness all-n + modular rep theory open]*

<!-- ───────── APPEND NEW CALCULATIONS BELOW THIS LINE (CALC-23, …) ───────── -->

## CALC-18 — Prime-2 structure: validation of the three-task Codex spec (∧² absent from the linear carrier; integral carrier ℤ/2; ∧² realized at degree 2 — corrects CALC-15)

**Context.** Will crystallised the unifying thesis: the carrier is `Sym²(std)`; every fault line is where symmetric-square information loses sign / orientation / faithfulness; the prime 2 is the boundary between coupling-as-magnitude (`Sym²`) and coupling-as-oriented-structure (`∧²`), via the swap involution `τ` on `std⊗std` (clean over ℤ[1/2], degenerate at 2). Before handing Codex the three-task probe (`codex_task_dbp_prime2_structure.md`), validated each task's load-bearing computation in-container (`validate_three_specs.py`). Murnaghan–Nakayama irreducible characters built from scratch and norm-checked before use.

**Finding 1 — the alternating companion is absent from the linear carrier.** *[computer-verified, n=4..7]*
`∧²(std)` has character `½(χ_std² − χ_std∘sq)` and decomposes as the single irreducible `S^(n−2,1,1)` (‖·‖²=1, dim `C(n−1,2)`). Inner product `⟨χ_{Im(L)}, χ_{S^(n−2,1,1)}⟩ = 0` for n=4..7 → the linear coupling carrier `Im(L) = Sym²(std) = triv ⊕ std ⊕ S^(n−2,2)` contains **no** alternating content. The orientation half is not in `Im(L)`; "coupling as oriented structure" has no carrier at first order.

**Finding 2 — the integral carrier is `ℤ^{C(n,2)} ⊕ ℤ/2`, the ℤ/2 = the phantom, uniform in n.** *[computer-verified, n=4..7]*
Smith normal form over ℤ of the gauge inclusion `M_G : ℤ^n → Sym²(ℤ^n)` (columns `G_g(e_a)` at `g=(1,…,1)`, entry `a_k+a_l`) gives invariant factors `[1,…,1,2]` — exactly one factor of 2 — for **every** n=4,5,6,7. Hence `Sym²(ℤ^n)/Im(G_g) ≅ ℤ^{C(n,2)} ⊕ ℤ/2`, generator the phantom `[g gᵀ]` (`2·g gᵀ = G_g(g) ∈ Im`, but `g gᵀ ∉ Im` over ℤ — needs `a=g/2`). So the char-2 phantom (Campaign H, CL-H10) **is** the 2-torsion of the integral carrier — the char-0 / char-2 stories are one lattice fact. Critically the torsion is the **same ℤ/2** at n=4 as at n≥5 — no spike at n=4 → evidence the phantom and the n=4 V₄ quotient are **distinct** 2-phenomena (uniform lattice torsion vs. an n=4 representation accident), *not* a single fact. [The full-`L` cokernel + the V₄ / modular reconciliation is the open T1 / T3 extension.]

**Finding 3 — CORRECTION to CALC-15: `∧²(std)` IS reachable from the symmetric Hessian, at degree 2.** *[computer-verified, n=5,6]*
Plethysm screen `⟨χ_{Sym^r(Sym²std)}, χ_{S^(n−2,1,1)}⟩` = **1** at r=2, and **8** (n=5) / **10** (n=6) at r=3. The alternating companion **appears in the degree-2 invariants of the coupling** and grows thereafter. CALC-15 concluded "climbing r surfaces no new representation content (stays in std)" — that verdict measured only the per-chart **std-norm**, a single scalar that by construction sees only triv⊕std. The full degree-2 content (`Sym²(Sym²std)`) is rich and already carries `S^(n−2,1,1)`. **The order axis is not shallow; CALC-15 tunneled on the wrong observable.** F1 reopens: live targets are the explicit degree-2 coupling invariant realising the alternating piece, and the full `Sym²(Sym²std)` decomposition (T2 extension).

**Refined thesis (to confirm / refute via the Codex tasks).** The prime 2 governs **three distinct layers**, not one: (a) the `ℤ/2` lattice torsion `[g gᵀ]` = the char-2 phantom, uniform in n; (b) the degree at which the alternating companion `S^(n−2,1,1)` enters the local invariants — degree 2, *not* the monodromy; (c) the 2-modular behaviour of the Specht modules `S^(n−2,2)` / `S^(n−2,1,1)`, where magnitude and orientation may or may not collide — with the n=4 V₄ accident belonging to layer (c), not (a). The thesis "every fault line is one fact" is too strong; the correct statement is a stratification across these three layers.

**Artifacts.** `validate_three_specs.py` (in-container validation, char tables built + norm-checked); `codex_task_dbp_prime2_structure.md` (the three-task spec — T1 integral torsion / phantom-vs-V₄; T2 realise `∧²` as explicit degree-2 invariant + full `Sym²(Sym²std)`; T3 2-modular collision). Each Codex task carries the validated gate above plus an open extension. Nothing canonical pending Will's review and the Gemini audit.

## CALC-19 — CORRECTION to CALC-18 Finding 2: the phantom ℤ/2 is gauge non-saturation (lives in ker L), not a torsion of the realised carrier Im(L) — which is torsion-free (Codex T1, independently reverified)

**Trigger.** Codex executed T1. Gate reproduced the gauge-inclusion SNF `[1,…,1,2]` exactly (n=4..7), confirming CALC-18 Finding 2's *gauge* computation. The T1 **extension** (full carrier `L` over ℤ, n=4..8) returned: `coker(L)` **torsion-free** — SNF(L) all-unit nonzero invariant factors, no ℤ/2, no n=4 spike. Reverified independently in-container (`verify_T1_fullL.py`, n=4,5,6): `rank(L)=C(n,2)`, SNF(L) nonunit factors `= []`, `L·(g gᵀ)=0` over ℤ, `L·gauge=0`.

**Resolution — two presentations of the carrier that agree over ℚ and split over ℤ by the phantom.**
- **Quotient model** `Sym²(ℤⁿ)/gauge_ℤ`: torsion `ℤ/2` (gate). Generator `[g gᵀ]`; the torsion is exactly the non-saturation `sat(gauge)/gauge ≅ ℤ/2` (`2·g gᵀ = G_g(g) ∈ gauge` but `g gᵀ ∉ gauge`).
- **Image model** `Im(L_ℤ) ⊂ flags`: torsion-free, saturated (SNF all 1). `ker(L_ℤ)` is saturated (kernels of integer maps always are) and `L` annihilates `g gᵀ`, so `ker(L_ℤ) = sat(gauge) ⊋ gauge`. `L` quotients by the **saturated** gauge → `Im(L) ≅ Sym²/sat(gauge) = ℤ^{C(n,2)}`, free. **L washes the phantom out.**

**What CALC-18 Finding 2 got wrong.** It stated "the integral carrier is `ℤ^{C(n,2)} ⊕ ℤ/2`." True of the *quotient* model, **false** of the realised carrier `Im(L)`. The phantom is a feature of the **gauge** (the redundancy / the kernel), not of the numerators the construction emits. CALC-18 conflated the two presentations. *[CALC-18 left intact as record per the no-silent-edit discipline; this is the correction.]*

**Why Campaign H still sees it.** Campaign H works in the quotient model and over F₂, where the non-saturation becomes a visible dimension jump: `dim(Sym²/gauge ⊗ F₂) = n(n+1)/2 − (n−1) = C(n,2)+1`, the "+1" = the phantom (CALC-16). `Im(L) ⊗ F₂` has rank `C(n,2)` (saturated, no jump). The phantom is real in the char-2 / quotient setting (Campaign H's setting) and absent from the numerator image — both true, different objects.

**Effect on the stratification (CALC-18 refined thesis) — strengthened, not weakened.** Layer (a) the phantom is now pinned to the **gauge / kernel** (upstream of `L`, washed out in the image). Layer (c) the 2-modular Specht behaviour, where V₄ lives, is in the **realised image** `Im(L) ⊗ F₂`. Provably different objects (kernel vs. image) → cannot be one fact. V₄ confirmed distinct from the phantom (no n=4 torsion in either model). The prime-2 story is a genuine stratification: (a) gauge non-saturation, (b) degree at which `∧²` enters [T2, pending], (c) modular Specht collision [T3, pending].

**Status.** T1 complete (gate + extension + V₄ reconciliation, Codex + independent reverify agree). T2, T3 pending Codex. `verify_T1_fullL.py` in container/outputs. Nothing canonical pending Will + Gemini.

## CALC-20 — Cross-check audit: second independent campaign (102 graded claims, byte-stable ×2) reproduces CALC-19 independently; the open decisive test (local degree-2 ∧², = T2) is untested by both runs

**Trigger.** Will ran a second independent campaign (`evals/dbp_involution/`, benches PAIR-SPLIT / Sym-Wedge Boundary / Alternating-Half Hunt; 102 records all `COMPUTER_VERIFIED`, two runs content-byte-stable) as a cross-check. Audited it against CALC-14/18/19 and Codex T1; verified two load-bearing integral/modular pieces in-container (`audit_second_campaign.py`, `audit_pd3.py`).

**Independent reproductions (no contradictions).**
- Stage 0: banked role-pair theorem, loss `=S^(n−2,2)` (dims 0,2,5,9,14,20 n=3..8), faithfulness margin `2(n−3)` / V₄ at n=4. (Reverified the n=4 corroboration myself: S₄ on the three 2+2 partitions has character (3,1,3,0,1) = triv ⊕ S^(2,2), the std rep of S₄/V₄.) ✓ = CALC-14.
- Stage A: `∧²(std)=S^(n−2,1,1)` has multiplicity 0 in the linear carrier `Im(L)`; carrier is entirely `Sym²` content (Schur + explicit projector). ✓ = CALC-18 Finding 1.
- Stage B: `O`-parity is degree-parity (`τ_O=+I` on the symmetric carrier), **not** the tensor-swap `τ`. ✓ = the spec/CALC-18 note, reached independently.
- Stage C: `L_flag` cokernel **torsion-free**; gauge quotient `Sym²/Im(G_g) = ℤ^{C(n,2)} ⊕ ℤ/2` single uniform phantom; their "honesty note" flags the other torsion presentation as a `½`-clearing convention artifact. **= CALC-19's two-presentation resolution, reached independently.** ✓
- Stage D: char-2 phantom generalises (linear core); `ker(channel mod 2)=gauge_mod2 ⊕ ⟨g gᵀ⟩`, all-n analog of CL-H10. ✓ consistent with CALC-19.

**Verified in-container.**
- (1) The campaign's `(ℤ/2)^{C(n,2)}` "Sym/∧ split cokernel" (exps 3,6,10,15,21,28) is the square of the **n-dim permutation lattice `ℤⁿ⊗ℤⁿ`** — `coker(Sym²(ℤᵐ)⊕∧²(ℤᵐ) ↪ ℤᵐ⊗ℤᵐ) = (ℤ/2)^{C(m,2)}`, m=n (verified m=3..6 → 3,6,10,15). The row label "std⊗std" is loose; genuine `std⊗std` (dim n−1) gives `(ℤ/2)^{C(n−1,2)} = 1,3,6,10,15,21`. The canonical claim (gauge `ℤ/2` phantom) is unaffected. *[labeling nuance, math correct]*
- (2) P-D3 char-2: `rank(L mod 2)=C(n,2)` (n=4..7) — **no mod-2 rank drop**, consistent with `Im(L)` saturated (CALC-19); gauge mod 2 rank n−1; `g gᵀ ∈ ker(L mod 2)` and independent of the gauge image; `ker(L mod 2)=gauge_mod2 ⊕ ⟨g gᵀ⟩` dim n. Exactly as reported. ✓

**The scope gap that matters.** The campaign's Stage E tested the **global / monodromy** route to `∧²` and found it non-canonical: at n=3, `∧²(std₃)=sign` appears as the block-action sign character (mult 1) in the alternating sheet-pairs of `S₃≀S₃`, but the 3 blocks are root-sheets of the stage-2 trinomial, not the 3 roles — no role-canonical bijection (CALC-10's wall). Verdict `no_canonical_comparison_map`. **This is NOT the local degree-2 route.** Neither campaign has tested whether the geometry **realises** `S^(n−2,1,1)` in the second-order coupling invariants (CALC-18 Finding 3 / spec T2): the plethysm places `∧²` in the *ambient* `Sym²(Sym²std)` (mult 1 at degree 2), but realizability is open.

**Reframing.** `THESIS_CONFIRMED_LOCAL_ONLY` is accurate for the first-order carrier + the monodromy route, but silent on second-order-local. By closing the global route as non-canonical, the cross-check makes **T2 the main live hope** for an actual `∧²` carrier: if `∧²` is realised at degree 2 locally, the oriented companion exists *without* the role-canonical cover the report says is missing. T2 (realizability of `S^(n−2,1,1)` in the degree-2 coupling) is now the decisive test untouched by **both** runs. Banked open thread from the campaign matching ours: all-n *nonlinear* RoleChSpec faithfulness in char 2 (= CALC-16).

**Status.** Cross-check passed, no contradictions, triangulation strong (CALC-19 independently confirmed). T2 = decisive open test; T3 (2-modular collision) pending. Audit scripts in container/outputs. Nothing canonical pending Will + Gemini.

## CALC-21 — T2 realizability RESOLVED (positive): the existing r=2 channel curvature realizes ∧²=S^(n−2,1,1) locally — the oriented companion has a concrete degree-2 observable carrier

**Trigger.** Will resolved the local degree-2 question: the full gauge-normal quadratic algebra on `O` carries `∧²(std)` (central projector on degree-2 `O`-monomials: n=4 rank 3 / target 3, n=5 rank 6 / target 6, witness `O_01·O_02` nonzero). Sharp caveat: this certifies the *full quadratic algebra*, not the narrower claim that the **existing r=2 channel-density observable** specifically hits that component (density-realization vs ambient-only — the open T2 extension). Resolved here.

**Structural reduction to one scalar.** The r=2 channel curvature is `κ_c = −Λ²/q²` per flag, and per-(chart,pair) the numerator `Λ` is exactly `L`. At the symmetric jet `q²` is a constant, so `κ_c = const · (Hadamard square of L(O))` — the density is the component-wise square of `Im(L) ⊂ M_flags`. Its `∧²` content is the `S^(n−2,1,1)`-component of the Hadamard-product map `μ : Sym²(Im L) → M_flags` (`μ` = diagonal extraction). Both `Sym²(Im L)=Sym²(Sym²std)` and `M_flags` carry `S^(n−2,1,1)` with **multiplicity 1**, so by Schur this is a single scalar `c` per n; `c≠0 ⇔ realized`.

**Target screen (necessary condition, passed).** `M_flags` (per-(chart,pair), the L-flags) contains `S^(n−2,1,1)` with mult 1 for n=4..7 — so the density is *not* blind by target. (Contrast: per-chart target `ℝⁿ=triv⊕std` has no `∧²` — blind. The per-(chart,3-subset) module has it for n≥5, mult 0 at n=4.)

**Verdict — REALIZED.** *[computer-verified n=4,5,6]* `density_realizes_wedge.py` / `density_wedge_n6.py`: the `S^(n−2,1,1)`-projection of the density's quadratic image has rank `3,6,10` = **full** `dim S^(n−2,1,1)` for n=4,5,6. In fact the density's quadratic image is **all** of `M_flags` (rank `12,30,60`) — maximally nondegenerate. Sanity gates: projector rank `= dim S^(n−2,1,1)` exactly; `Im(L)` projects to 0 (linear carrier blind, as required). So `c≠0`: the existing per-(chart,pair) channel curvature carries the full oriented companion.

**Reconciles CALC-15 completely.** Realization is **granularity-dependent**. The natural §8 r=2 bordered-minor density is per-(chart,pair) (target `M_flags`) → realizes `∧²`. The **aggregate per-chart** observable (target `ℝⁿ=triv⊕std`, e.g. the std-norm `A_c`) is blind to `∧²` by target — exactly what CALC-15 measured. So CALC-15's "order axis stays in std" was blind on *two* counts: aggregate granularity *and* the norm projection. The genuine §8 density at the correct granularity carries the alternating half in full.

**Consequence for the prime-2 thesis.** "Coupling as oriented structure" has a concrete, local, degree-2 observable carrier: the per-(chart,pair) channel curvature `κ_c`. The oriented companion is **realized**, not merely ambient — and **locally**, so the global/monodromy route (CALC-20 Stage E, `no_canonical_comparison_map`) is *not required* for the alternating half to have a carrier. The stratification stands: (a) phantom `ℤ/2` in the gauge/kernel; (b) `∧²` realized at degree 2 in the local channel curvature [now closed, positive]; (c) 2-modular Specht collision [T3, pending].

**Status.** T2 fully resolved (realized, n=4,5,6; structural Schur reduction + direct projection). T3 (2-modular collision) the remaining open task. `density_target_screen.py`, `density_realizes_wedge.py`, `density_wedge_n6.py` in container/outputs. Nothing canonical pending Will + Gemini.

## CALC-22 — T3 RESOLVED: magnitude and orientation collide mod 2, generically — [S^(n−2,1,1)] = [S^(n−2,2)] + [D^(n)] (orientation = shape + trivial), n=4..7; V₄ is the n=4 special case, not the mechanism

**Trigger.** Writing the T3 handoff; validated the modular-collision core in-container (`t3_modular_validate.py`, `t3_modular_fixed.py`), which closed the question. `dim D^μ` = F₂-rank of the James polytabloid Gram form, validated against knowns (D^(2,1)=2, D^(3,1)=2, D^(4,1)=4, D^(3,2)=4, trivials 1). Decomposition numbers recovered by dominance-decreasing peeling of Brauer characters; every result non-negative and dimension-checked by assertion.

**Result.** *[computer-verified n=4..7]*
- n=4: shape `S^(2,2)=D^(3,1)`; orient `S^(2,1,1)=D^(4)+D^(3,1)`.
- n=5: shape `S^(3,2)=D^(5)+D^(3,2)`; orient `S^(3,1,1)=2·D^(5)+D^(3,2)`.
- n=6: shape `S^(4,2)=D^(6)+D^(5,1)+D^(4,2)`; orient `S^(4,1,1)=2·D^(6)+D^(5,1)+D^(4,2)`.
- n=7: shape `S^(5,2)=D^(5,2)`; orient `S^(5,1,1)=D^(7)+D^(5,2)`.

**Pattern (all 4 cases): `[S^(n−2,1,1)] = [S^(n−2,2)] + [D^(n)]`** in the mod-2 Grothendieck group — orientation = shape + one trivial. So every composition factor of the shape is a factor of the orientation: the collision is **total** (shape ⊆ orient factors), shared = all shape factors. *[all-n is conjecture; strong evidence, 4 consecutive cases, dimension-verified]*

**Interpretation.** The Specht-level content of the Sym/∧ split failing at 2 (CALC-20). Over F₂ the symmetric-shape `S^(n−2,2)` and the alternating `∧²(std)=S^(n−2,1,1)` become equal up to a trivial — magnitude and orientation genuinely collide mod 2. The extra trivial `D^(n)` is the candidate fingerprint of the diagonal / polarization (possibly = the phantom `g gᵀ`, CALC-19 — open).

**V₄ reconciliation.** The collision is GENERIC (all n) → not a V₄ phenomenon. At n=4, `S^(2,2)=D^(3,1)` is the lift of modular `std_{S₃}` through `S₄/V₄`, but that normality is n=4-only, whereas `orient=shape+trivial` holds at every n. So V₄ is the n=4 SPECIAL CASE of the generic collision, distinct from the mechanism — consistent with CALC-19/20 (phantom and V₄ distinct), now extended (modular collision and V₄ also distinct).

**STRATIFICATION CLOSED.** The prime-2 thesis resolves into three distinct, individually-pinned layers:
- (a) phantom `ℤ/2` in the gauge/kernel, washed out of the image, uniform in n [CALC-19/20];
- (b) `∧²` realised at degree 2 in the local channel curvature, full projection [CALC-21];
- (c) magnitude & orientation collide mod 2 generically, `orient=shape+trivial`, V₄ the n=4 special case [CALC-22].
Unifying object: `std⊗std` with swap `τ` — carrier = `+1` (symmetric) eigenspace, `∧²` = `−1`, prime 2 = where the eigenspace split fails, manifesting as (a) lattice torsion, (b) the degree at which `−1`-content enters the local observable, (c) the mod-2 collision of the `+1`-shape and `−1`-orientation Specht modules. "Every fault line is one fact" → false; the correct statement is this stratification.

**Open (genuine remaining math).** Prove `[S^(n−2,1,1)]=[S^(n−2,2)]+[D^(n)]` for all n (theorem); identify the extra trivial (= phantom?); extend computation to higher n. = the T3 handoff.

**Status.** T1, T2, T3 all resolved in-container. Handoff = independent reproduction + the all-n proof. Scripts `t3_modular_validate.py`, `t3_modular_fixed.py`. Nothing canonical pending Will + Gemini.

# ═══════════ PHASE 2 — TRANSCENDENTAL HUNT (distinct program) ═══════════
*Phase-1 (CALC-01…22) mapped the prime-2 representation structure of the coupling carrier. Phase-2 hunts genuine transcendentals/irrationals in the framework. The framework is exact-ℚ at every finite n,r,depth by construction, so a transcendental cannot be algebraic-combinatorial — it must come from a genuine analytic operation (a limit, or a period/integral). This narrows the search to (i) limits n/r/depth→∞ and (ii) periods/integrals/geodesic/monodromy cycles. Method: build a "constant trap" (compute to high precision, identify by PSLQ + analytic reduction), not "does π appear?".*

## CALC-23 — TRAP #1 (Gauss–Bonnet) FIRED & FULLY IDENTIFIED: the total Gaussian curvature of the DBP constraint surface is a genuine NON-CM elliptic period (j=128) — provably not π·algebraic, not Γ(1/3), not Γ(1/4)

**Trap.** Total curvature `∫∫_S K_G dA` (Gauss–Bonnet "constant trap") of the DBP constraint surface `D²+DS+P²=3` — a one-sheeted hyperboloid, signature (2,1), topologically a cylinder (χ=0, non-compact). A period of the surface itself (place (ii)).

**Sanity gate — PASSED.** The induced-metric Gaussian curvature at the keystone `(1,1,1)` is exactly `−3/49`, identical to the orbit-calculus keystone (CALC chain) and to the implicit-surface value `−det(bordered Hess)/|∇F|⁴ = −12/196`. So the parametrization carries DBP's *intrinsic* geometry, not an extrinsic artifact. *[computer-verified + proven]* — **Stronger (new):** the bordered-Hessian determinant evaluates to `4(D²+DS+P²)` for this `F`, hence `≡ 12` *identically on the surface* `D²+DS+P²=3`. So the curvature field has the clean global closed form `K_G = −12/|∇F|⁴ = −12/[(2D+S)²+D²+4P²]²` everywhere — not merely the keystone point value. *[proven]* (And under the parametrization the gradient simplifies: `2D+S = 2√3·cosh t·cosθ`, the `sinh t` cancelling.)

**Value.** *[computer-verified by three mutually independent routes]*
```
∫∫_S K_G dA = −5.010490702660418769050021160526777648057…  =  (−1.594888725…)·π
```
Three routes, each independent of the others' machinery: **(A)** raw 2D surface integral over the `(t,θ)` parametrization, made **truncation-free** by the `t=artanh u` compactification (the whole `t∈ℝ` tail folds into a bounded smooth integrand on `[−1,1]`) — confirms to **60 digits**, cross-confirmed independently on a separate machine, and via two *independent* `K_G` implementations (full bordered-Hessian `det`, and the derived global form `−12/|∇F|⁴`); independent of *all* downstream Gauss-map/elliptic reductions; **(B)** the `κ_g` triple-product 1D integral — independent of the elliptic reduction; **(C)** the elliptic `J2` / Byrd–Friedman route. All three routes agree to **60 digits**. *Methodological note:* a fixed `[−L,L]` cutoff on route (A) freezes a systematic tail bias `~e^{−2L}` that byte-stability across working precisions cannot detect — both precisions resolve the same truncated integrand and cross-validate to 60+ digits while silently sharing the bias (an `L≈30` cutoff caps true agreement at ~25 digits regardless of dps). Compactification removes it by tying precision and tail-reach together. *(Caught live: a fixed-`L` raw run mismatched at digit 25 by exactly `7.71e-26 = e^{−60}`; the compactified rerun then matched all three routes to 60.)* `val/π` is non-algebraic (PSLQ minpoly deg≤4 returns only ~10⁶-scale noise). Standard (un-sheared) hyperboloid gives the clean `−2√2·π` — so the constant is **surface-specific: the `DS` shear is exactly what breaks the algebraic·π cleanliness.**

**Reduction chain.** *[proven; each link checked numerically to 40–61 digits]*
The total curvature is the signed area of the Gauss image = `−2×` the total geodesic curvature of the asymptotic-cone Gauss curve `C₊` (verified on the standard hyperboloid → `−2√2π`). The κ_g integrand collapses symbolically: `γ=n/L` unit ⟹ `det(γ,γ',γ'')=det(n,n',n'')/L³`, and `det(n,n',n'')=4` (constant); the `|γ'|²` denominator reduces to exactly `8(3−cosφ)`. Hence
```
∫∫_S K_G dA = −2∮_{C₊}κ_g ds = −∫₀^{2π} √(cos²φ−2cosφ+5)/(3−cosφ) dφ
            = −8 ∫₀^{π/2} sin²θ /√(1+sin⁴θ) dθ          (note L² = 4(1+sin⁴(φ/2)))
            = −4 ∫₀¹ w dw /√(w(1−w)(1+w²))               (w = sin²θ)
```

**Elliptic structure.** *[proven]* Lives on `y² = w(1−w)(1+w²)`, branch points `{0, 1, i, −i}`, cross-ratio `−i`, **j-invariant = 128 (sympy exact)**. 128 is NOT among the 13 class-number-1 CM `j`-values `{0, 1728, −3375, 8000, 54000, 287496, −32768, −884736, …}`, and it is rational so it cannot be higher class number ⟹ **definitively non-CM**. This is *why* Γ(1/4) (lemniscatic, j=1728) and Γ(1/3) (equianharmonic, j=0) sweeps both failed: a non-CM curve has no Chowla–Selberg Γ-evaluation.

**Period data.** First-kind period `J1 ≔ ∫₀¹ dw/√Q = 2^{3/4}·K(k)`, `k² = (2−√2)/4` *[proven via Byrd–Friedman modulus `k²=[(α−β)²−(A−B)²]/(4AB)` with A²=2,B²=1; computer-verified to 30 digits]* — a NON-singular modulus (consistent with non-CM). Period relation `J1+J2 = 2J3` (which collapses the object to `loop = 2J2`) is **proven** via the curve involution `w ↦ (1−w)/(1+w)`: it swaps the real branch points `0↔1`, sends `Q(v) = 4Q(w)/(1+w)⁴` so `dw/√Q` is anti-invariant, and the integrand-function `(w²+2w−1)/(1+w)` is also anti-invariant (`h(v)=−h(w)`) — forcing `∫₀¹(w²+2w−1)/((1+w)√Q)dw` to equal its own negative, hence `=0`. *[proven + computer-verified to 50 digits]*

**CLOSED FORM.** *[computer-verified to 61 digits; derivation proven link-by-link via the B&F substitution `w(u)=(1−cn u)/((1+√2)+(√2−1)cn u)`, characteristic `n=(4−3√2)/8` from the cn-form→Legendre Π conversion]*
```
∫∫_S K_G dA  =  −2^{7/4} · [ (3+2√2)·Π( (4−3√2)/8 ; (2−√2)/4 )  −  (2+2√2)·K( (2−√2)/4 ) ]
```
(Π = Legendre complete elliptic integral of the 3rd kind, K = 1st kind; modulus parameter `m=k²=(2−√2)/4`, characteristic `n=(4−3√2)/8`.)

**THE FINDING.** The DBP total curvature is a **genuine non-CM elliptic period** (first + third kind on `y²=w(1−w)(1+w²)`, j=128). It is provably transcendental and provably NOT expressible via π, radicals, logarithms, or Γ-values at rational arguments — the non-CM structure is the rigorous backbone (no Chowla–Selberg), with PSLQ to 70–90 digits against π/Γ(1/3)/Γ(1/4)/lemniscatic/equianharmonic bases as corroboration. Not "π shows up" (forced) but a *new* period tied specifically to the role-shear `DS`. The trap caught exactly the kind of object the framework's exact-ℚ finiteness predicted: an honest analytic period, fully closed-form.

**Open / loose ends.** (1) ~~`J1+J2=2J3` empirical~~ — **now CLOSED**: proven via the curve involution `w↦(1−w)/(1+w)` (the real-branch-swap of `y²=w(1−w)(1+w²)`; see Period data). (2) The non-CM transcendentality of Π-periods is rigorous at the structural level; a fully formal "not a Γ-value" proof would invoke Wüstholz/period-theory machinery (not carried out here). (3) Other traps unexplored: place-(i) limits (generating function `Σ_r Ĉ_r s^r` at special points; n→∞ asymptotics) and place-(ii) monodromy period (the self-glue cubic — different analytic object, possibly a *different* constant).

## CALC-24 — TRAP #2 (monodromy) FIRED + the ANISOTROPY ARITHMETIC LANDSCAPE: curvature and monodromy are two registers of one S₄ with the SAME Γ(1/3) → non-CM → Γ(1/4) skeleton; CM walls sit at coupling-degeneration loci

**Frame.** Asked whether the curvature period goes "special" (CM) as a function of coupling / role count, to test the n=4 V₄ accident arithmetically. Result in four parts: (A) the literal n-family hits a dimension wall, but the curvature `j` maps exactly over coupling anisotropy; (B) the curvature `j` is structurally *blind* to V₄ (it is the S₄-magnitude invariant); (C) the V₄/shape arithmetic lives in the monodromy register, which fired and hands back Γ(1/3); (D) both registers share one arithmetic skeleton.

### Part A — dimension wall + curvature anisotropy landscape
**Dimension wall.** The canonical n=4 surface (CALC-04, `Σyᵢ²+Σ_{i<j}yᵢyⱼ−65`) is a 3-manifold in ℝ⁴ (one equation, four variables). The total-curvature *elliptic* period is a 2-surface object (cone → conic cross-section → elliptic curve); for n≥4 roles the surface is (n−1)-dimensional and the invariant changes species (Gauss–Kronecker / Chern–Gauss–Bonnet). So "the n-role curvature elliptic period" does not type-check past n=3 — the elliptic handle is **bonded to the 3-role / 2-surface geometry**. *[proven]*

**Anisotropy landscape.** Parametrize coupling: `Q_s = x² + s·xy + z²` (s=1 = keystone). Correct cone normal `n(φ;s) = (cosφ, (s/2)(cosφ−1), sinφ)` ⟹ `n·n = 1 + s²·sin⁴(φ/2)` (the keystone's `1+sin⁴` with `s²` threaded in). So the total-curvature elliptic curve is `y² = w(1−w)(1+s²w²)`, branch points `{0, 1, ±i/s}`, and
```
j(s) = (1728 s⁶ − 1728 s⁴ + 576 s² − 64) / (s⁶ + 2 s⁴ + s²)
```
*[proven from branch points; computer-verified — the form-route geodesic-curvature integral lives on this curve, ratio `|∮κ_g ds| = s·2J2` clean across s=1,2,3,1/√3, and s=1 reproduces the keystone 2.5052]*

The landscape (`j` **monotone increasing** on `(0,∞)`, from `−∞` to `1728` — *[proven]*: `dj/ds = 128(3s²−1)²(9s²+1)/(s⁶+2s⁴+s²)² ≥ 0`, so every `J<1728` has a *unique* `s`; the `(3s²−1)²` double zero at `s=1/√3` is why `j=0` is a triple-contact `(3u−1)³` tangency, not a crossing):
- `s → 0` : degenerate (nodal, j→−∞) — isotropic / no-coupling limit → **rational·π**
- *(small s)* : a discrete CM ladder at negative `j` (disc −7, −11, −19, −27, −43, −67, −163), all in the weak-coupling band `s<1/√3` — **mapped exactly in Part E**
- `s = 1/√3` : **j = 0**, equianharmonic, CM ℤ[ω] → **Γ(1/3)**
- `s = 1` : **j = 128**, **non-CM** (the keystone — no Γ-value; this is CALC-23)
- `s → ∞` : **j = 1728**, lemniscatic, CM ℤ[i] → **Γ(1/4)**

Keystone sits generic, flanked by Γ(1/3) (below, s=1/√3) and Γ(1/4) (s→∞). Every classical period-constant is a specific coupling strength of one trap.

### Part B — why curvature is BLIND to V₄ (the magnitude/shape split, in geometry)
The curvature curve has four branch points `{0,1,±i/s}` (its 2-torsion); S₄ permutes them. **`j(s)` is the S₄-symmetric invariant** of those points (the modular invariant) — invariant under *all* of S₄, including V₄ — so **`j` cannot see the V₄ pairing.** The resolvent cubic of the four points has roots `{1/s², ±i/s}`, discriminant `−4(s²+1)²/s¹⁰` (always `<0`, never `0` for real s>0 ⟹ resolvent Galois = S₃ = S₄/V₄ across the whole family). *[computer-verified, exact]*

This is the carrier's magnitude/shape split (CALC-08/10) realized in the curvature setting:

| carrier (representation theory) | curvature trap (geometry) |
|---|---|
| per-chart **magnitude** `(C)` — S₄-symmetric, faithful nowhere at n=4 | the **`j`-invariant** — S₄-symmetric, blind to V₄ |
| the **(2,2) shape loss** — what `(C)` discards `= S₄/V₄` | the **resolvent cubic** — what `j` discards `= S₄/V₄` |

So curvature (Trap #1) was never going to detect V₄: `j` lives on the **magnitude** side of the split. The V₄ / shape arithmetic is the **monodromy** register. *[proven structural; corroborates CALC-08/10 — the (2,2) doublet IS resolvent-cubic monodromy]*

### Part C — TRAP #2 (monodromy) FIRED: the self-glue cubic → Γ(1/3)
The self-glue cubic fixture `F = D³ + DS + P² − 3` (self_glue_monodromy §2, m_D=3) is itself an **elliptic fibration over the substrate**: `P² = 3 − D³ − SD` ⟹ `y² = x³ + S x + 3` (x=D, y=P). Hence
```
j(S) = 6912 S³ / (4 S³ + 243)
```
*[proven from the y²=x³+ax+b j-formula]*
- `S = 0` : **j = 0**, equianharmonic, CM ℤ[ω] → **Γ(1/3)**. Real period `= Γ(1/3)³ · (3/2)^{1/3} / π` *[computer-verified: `(period·π / Γ(1/3)³)³ = 3/2` exact]*
- `S = 1` : **j = 6912/247**, **non-CM**
- `S → ∞` : **j = 1728**, lemniscatic → **Γ(1/4)**

`S = 0` is the framework's own **omega-substrate degeneration** (self_glue §8: `S₂=0` slaves the product branch to the seam) — the Γ(1/3) wall sits at a **coupling collapse**, not a random point. Will's original prediction ("if the self-glue cubic is equianharmonic it hands back Γ(1/3)") confirmed.

### Part D — UNIFICATION: two registers, one arithmetic skeleton

| register | Γ(1/3) wall | non-CM generic | Γ(1/4) wall |
|---|---|---|---|
| **curvature** (shear `s`) | `s = 1/√3` | `s=1`: `j=128` | `s → ∞` |
| **monodromy** (substrate `S`) | `S = 0` | `S=1`: `j=6912/247` | `S → ∞` |

Two **independent** machineries — geometric curvature (magnitude / S₄-symmetric register) and Galois monodromy (shape / S₄÷V₄ register) — map to **identical arithmetic**: Γ(1/3) at one coupling-degeneration limit, Γ(1/4) at the other, non-CM generic between. The CM/Γ walls **coincide with coupling-degeneration loci**, and the two registers independently agree on those loci.

**THE FINDING.** The arithmetic class of a DBP surface (CM vs non-CM, *which* Γ-value) is a **closed-form function of coupling**, in *both* registers; the Γ-value walls are the **coupling-degeneration loci**; generic/healthy coupling is **non-CM in both**. The diagnostic-ladder hypothesis — "arithmetic class reports coupling health; a fault drops you onto a special wall" — is now exact and **cross-validated across two disjoint lenses**. The keystone's non-CM `j=128` is the generic value of a *working* coupling; Γ(1/3) / Γ(1/4) are the arithmetic fingerprints of it *breaking*, visible identically through curvature and through monodromy.

### Part E — the exact CM ladder (resolves Part-A open item)
Each class-number-1 CM `j`-value `J` pins a coupling strength via the rung equation in `u=s²` (the cleared `j(s)=J`):
```
(1728−J) u³ − (1728+2J) u² + (576−J) u − 64 = 0        [coeffs = (1728−J, −(1728+2J), 576−J, −64)]
```
take the unique real root in `(0,⅓)` (uniqueness = monotonicity, Part A). The full `h=1` ladder, ordered by increasing `s` (= increasing `j`, weakest coupling → Γ(1/3) floor):

| `d` | `j(d)` | coupling `s` | exact `s` / minimal polynomial in `u=s²` |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| −163 | −262537412640768000 | 1.56133×10⁻⁸ | root of `4102147072512027u³+8204294145023973u²+4102147072512009u−1` |
| −67 | −147197952000 | 2.08516×10⁻⁵ | root of `2299968027u³+4599935973u²+2299968009u−1` |
| −43 | −884736000 | 0.000268957 | root of `13824027u³+27647973u²+13824009u−1` |
| −27 | −12288000 | 0.00228211 | root of `192027u³+383973u²+192009u−1` |
| −19 | −884736 | 0.00850179 | root of `13851u³+27621u²+13833u−1` |
| −11 | −32768 | 0.0437308 | root of `539u³+997u²+521u−1` |
| −7 | −3375 | 0.125988 | **`s = 1/(3√7) = √7/21`**, exact (`u=1/63`; cubic factors `(63u−1)(81u²+81u+64)`) |
| −3 | 0 | 0.577350 | **`s = 1/√3`**, Γ(1/3) floor (triple contact) |

*[proven: rung equation + monotone uniqueness; computer-verified: roots to 50 digits, `ladder.py`]*

**Structure of the ladder:**
1. **`d=−7` is the only exact-closed-form rung** — `u=1/63` rational, `s=1/(3√7)` (the `√7` under the disc-`−7` wall is a factorization coincidence, but a clean one). Every other rung is **irreducible degree-3 in `u=s²`** (degree-6 in `s`); the minimal polynomial *is* the exact object. *[proven]*
2. **The whole discrete ladder is a weak-coupling phenomenon** — every `h=1` CM wall sits at `s<1/√3`, compressing geometrically toward `s=0` as `s ≈ 8/√(−j_d)`; the deep Heegner discriminants `−67,−163` are crushed against zero coupling (`s~10⁻⁵, 10⁻⁸`). *[proven]*
3. **The operational band is CM-clean** — `s∈(1/√3,∞)` (containing the keystone `s=1`) has **no class-number-1 CM walls**: the `h=1` values above `1728` (`8000, 54000, 287496, 16581375`) are *unreachable* since `j<1728` for every finite `s`. So `j` runs uninterrupted from the Γ(1/3) floor to the Γ(1/4) ceiling, and the keystone's `j=128` sits in open non-CM water. *[proven for h=1]* (Higher class number `h≥2` walls *do* populate that band, densely on the unit `τ`-arc, but at algebraic-irrational `s` with irrational `j` — the rational-`j` ladder is purely the weak-side `h=1` one.)

**Diagnostic reading (sharpened).** A fault modeled as *weakening* coupling walks **down** the ladder `−7 → −11 → −19 → …` toward total decoupling at `s=0`; *strengthening* past the keystone slides toward the Γ(1/4) ceiling with no rungs to catch on. The CM ladder is a **weak-side** signature — decoupling faults hit discrete arithmetic walls; over-coupling faults do not. *[interpretation]*

**Open / next.** (1) The diagnostic claims (fault → CM wall) are structural conjectures pending a fault-injection test on a real surface. (2) ~~The small-s CM ladder is unmapped~~ — **RESOLVED in Part E** (full `h=1` ladder exact; `h≥2` denser strong-side ladder at algebraic-irrational `s` characterized but not enumerated). (3) Place-(i) limit traps (generating-function / n→∞) still unexplored.
